# Introduction

Axis SDK Unity Package communicates with Axis Control Center. To use the plugin, you must have Axis Control Center installed and running, and also must have calibrated your Axis System.

# How to use this package:

After installing the SDK, it's advised to import the tutorials and samples scenes from Package Manager. To do so, click on Window > Package Manager. Then on the top bar, select Packages: 'In Project' and on the side bar, select the Axis SDK.

On the main panel, under Samples, click on Import for both 'Axis Tutorials' and 'Example Scenes'.

# To run the Tutorials:

Click on Tutorials on the toolbar and then on Show Tutorials. On the right side bar all the available tutorials will be shown. It's recommended to follow them in order, but not essential.

# The included samples:

There are 4 samples for different Axis uses. When the Sample scene is a bit more complex, there is also a Readme file on the folder to explain what is going on.
